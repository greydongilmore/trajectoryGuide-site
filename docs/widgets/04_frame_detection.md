## Run automatic frame detection

<p align="center"><img src="img/frame_detection.png" alt="frame_detection"/></p>

Click on the drop down menu next to `Fiducial Volume` and select the volume containing the stereotactic frame. Select the stereotactic frame you are using and press `Detect Frame Fiducials`. If the automatic detection was successful you will see an image like this:

!!! note
    To navigate through the 2D view:<br>
    **Move across scan**: hold `Shift` while moving the mouse<br>
    **Zoom in/out**: hold the `right` mouse button while moving mouse up/down (can hold `Control/Command` and scroll)

You can scroll up/down the slices to check the accuracy of the frame detection. The labels shown are a combination of the fiducial point number and the Z axis coordinate. You may also notice the fiducial points for the frame center and midpoints on the diagonal bars of the N-localizer.

When you are satisfied with the results select `Confirm Frame Fiducials`. If you are not satisfied, you can move on to manual frame detection.

## Run manual frame detection

To run manual frame detection select the button `Manual Dection`. A set of 9 point fiducials will appear, which you will define on the same axial slice.
