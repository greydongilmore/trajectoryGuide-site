## What is DBS?
-------------------
DBS, short for Deep Brain Stiumation, is an established surgical treatment for people with movement disroders, such as Parkinson's disease and dystonia. It involves implanting electrodes (thin metal wires) within certain areas of the brain and sending electrical impulses to the brain through these electrodes. The electrical impulses are controlled a device that's implanted by the chest.
