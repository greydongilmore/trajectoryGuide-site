## What is DBS?

Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), is an established neurosurgical treatment for individuals living with a movement disorder, such as Parkinsons disease. The surgical process involves chronic implantation of stimulation electrodes within specific areas of the brain. The electrodes send electrical impulses to the brain to alleviate motor symptoms associated with the movement disorder.
